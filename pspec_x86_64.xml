        <Description xml:lang="en">Moolticute aims to be an easy companion to your Mooltipass device and extend the power of the device to more platform/tools. With it you can manage your Mooltipass with a cross-platform app, as well as provide a daemon service that handle all USB communication with the device.
This tool is written with a daemon that runs in background, and a user interface app to control you Mooltipass. Other clients could also connect and talk to the daemon (it uses a websocket connection and simple JSON messages). The official Mooltipass App only works with Chrome as it relies on USB HID library that is only implemented in Chrome. A Firefox (or any other browser) extension could easily be written by using the Moolticute daemon.
It is completely cross platform, and runs on Linux (using libusb), OS X (native IOKit API), and Windows (native HID API).
